Ideas for TDDE16 project
- Sentiment analysis
    - Customer reviews of a service
    - Movie reviews
- Classification
    (a) Create playlist based on the mood of the song based on lyrics 
    (b) Predict the author of a tweet/text -- real world application --> find which person wrote what part in a research paper

What is x and how can it be used? 
- LTSM, long term short memory, process sequences -- classification, supported by pytorch keras 
- BERT, BERT-base, BERTopic?, transformer based -- classification complex stuff 
- LSA- more in lecture 3, relationsship between sets of documents -- exploratory data analysis


--- Supervisor meeting 8/11-2022 --- 
Find dataset, is dataset correctly annotated, how to evaluate the results 
alt. find data set and then think what it can be used for 
Standard stuff are already covered --> find other techniques? 

For the next meeting: 
- Decide on idea 
- Find data set to use 
- Find methods on how to solve the problem 



--- Supervisor meeting 30/11-2022 --- 
* Ask about if the diagnostic test can be done on distance 

Idea: Analysis of song lyrics to create a playlist based on the mood using emotion detection/recognition?

Emotion detection/recognition: identify the emotion (e.g. happy, sad, angry) in a text 
Sentiment analysis: positive, neutral or negative opinion in a text
Is the approach same in both cases? Which would be the most suited for this idea?

Dataset
(1) https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/edenbd/150k-lyrics-labeled-with-spotify-valence 
- use valence or VADER to assign a label
(2) http://softeng.polito.it/erion/ 
- MoodyLyrics4Q (emotions based on Russell's Model- happy, sad, angry, relaxed)
    - pre-annotated dataset but less data, 2000 

---> alternative idea: compare gold standard labelled data with silver standard labelled data (?) song lyrics

--> does lyrics emotion correlate to valence, use MoodyLyrics4Q to validate
mood conveyed by lyrics correlated with whats conveyed by music/tune 
background about, annotation, what does it mean
sentiment analysis on lyrics in big dataset

sentiment analysis on different models? -->validate? 


Methods:
KNN, SVM, BERT? compare between

Both (1) and (3) uses the song valence as a positive or negative label, (2) uses VADER to create a label

- BERT 
- Sentiment analysis 

(2) https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-analyze-emotions-and-words-of-the-lyrics-from-your-favorite-music-artist-bbca10411283
- specifically section 3. Sentiment Analysis of Songs Lyrics
    - VADER 

(3) https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/lyric-mood-identifier-c8e94a49c73 

(4) https://github.com/sgiammy/emotion-patterns-in-music-playlists 

Spotify valence: musical positiveness of the track - high = more positive/happy, low = more negative/sad

Evaluation:
- F1 score? 
- Build a playlist and determine the mood? "user test"
