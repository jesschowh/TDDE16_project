Ideas for TDDE16 project
- Sentiment analysis
    - Customer reviews of a service
    - Movie reviews
- Classification
    - Create playlist based on the mood of the song based on lyrics 
    - Predict the author of a tweet/text -- real world application --> find which person wrote what part in a research paper

What is x and how can it be used? 
- LTSM, long term short memory, process sequences -- classification, supported by pytorch keras 
- BERT, BERT-base, BERTopic?, transformer based -- classification complex stuff 
- LSA- more in lecture 3, relationsship between sets of documents -- exploratory data analysis
